# CapacityBay-Second-javaScript-Assignment

Question 1
In this challenge, you are going to create a function that tells us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live until 90 years old. It will take your current age as the input and console.logs a message with our time left in this format: You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

function lifeInWeeks(age) {
   
/************Don't change the code above************/    
   
    //Write your code here.
   
   
   
   
   
/*************Don't change the code below**********/
}




Question 2
Now we want to build a love calculator that will give us how many percent match are 2 partners
 
Build a love Calculator that takes 2 name inputs, then generate a random number that tells us if they are match
i.e firstinput = John, secondinput = Mary, then return:
John and Mary are 75% match!!


Note: 75% is the random number generated, if i rerun the program with the same name it should give me a different percentage, and also your random number should from 0% to 100%
And also this is not a real love calculator, it won't give you a real result, don't test this with your partners "Laugh...."
Thanks and GoodLuck!!
